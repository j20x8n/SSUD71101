3.         Interpret basic site   plans and construction drawings,   and   extract   particular information   required
Stimulus:   
This assignment allows you to demonstrate your understanding of site   analysis,   the   relationship   between   site   and   built form, and the common elements of residential construction   in   south-east   Queensland.
There are three   parts to this assignment. All group members   are   expected to   contribute   to   all   parts.
Scenario:
This assignment builds   upon the groundwork   laid   in Assignment   1. To   proceed, your group   must collectively choose one of the addresses assessed by each   team   member   in Assignment   1.   The   entire   assessment will be centered around this selected site address.   It   is assumed   that the   chosen   site   is   currently   vacant,   with   any   existing structures   having been demolished.
Following a thorough examination of the vacant allotment chosen   in Assignment   1, your task   is to   select   a   single-story   house design that adheres to the site's setback and   site   cover   restrictions. Additionally,   the   chosen design should be well-suited for a family of four, including   two   active   teenagers.
The   house   plan that you choose must   be from one of the following   building companies:
1.         Plantation   Homes
2.         Masterton   Homes
3.         Beechwood   Homes
4.         GJ Gardner Homes   (great for sloping   lots)
5.         Pivot   Homes (great for sloping   lots)
6.         Sanctuary   New   Homes (great for sloping   lots)
7.         McDonald Jones   Homes (great for sloping   lots)
The   house that you choose should carefully consider the   potential needs   of the   occupants   and   should   ideally:
•             Minimise the required   earthworks.
•          Take   maximum   advantage   of views, solar   access   and   prevailing   breezes   in   order   to   efficiently   light   and   heat/cool the   house.
•             Be sized and positioned on the   land   so that   it   permits   room   for   landscaping   features   such   as   a future   pool and gardens and   a   driveway.


Task   description:
Part   1: Site and   House   Summary   (10%)
In tabulated or bullet point format give a   brief description   of the   house   you   have   selected for   the   site.   Use   the   following   headings, but do   not be   restricted   by these.
•                      Building   company who   created   the   design,   and   the   name   of the   design.
•                      Description   of   inclusions –   number   of   bedrooms,   bathrooms,   car   spaces,   etc.
•                        Floor areas – indoor/outdoor and total
•                         Brief   description of its   construction   materials –   e.g.    frame,   cladding, floor   system,   roofing   material
•                      How   the   house   suits   the   proposed   occupants   in   terms   of space   usage
•                      The   suggested   substructure/ground   shaping   strategy
Part 2:   Detailed   Room   Construction   Schedule   (20%)
Choose one of the ‘wet’ areas   in your house – bathroom,   ensuite,   laundry   or   kitchen.
1.                   Draw a dimensioned   plan   of your selected   space   at   a   scale   of   1:20. You will   need   to   scale   from   your   house   plan for this (by   hand or using   a   CAD   software/app)
2.                   Create a detailed construction   schedule for the   space,   commencing   at   the   stage where   slab/floor, wall    roof framing are   in   place,   through to the space being   ready for   occupation/use.Your schedule should   be   in tabulated, timeline or bullet point format,   in   approximately   chronological   order,   and   include for all the finishes and fixtures which would   be   provided.   Make use of   photographs to illustrate   the various   items (where relevant). Give an example   of the   supplier   of the   item   and the   trade which would install/erect it. (i.e., wall framing – Carpenter).
Part 3   Construction   Drawings    Scale   Model   (60%)
Note:   Drawings   maybe   created   by   hand   or   by   CAD
Site   Plan and Site   Analysis   (10%)
Scale   1:200
a.          Prepare a site   plan of your chosen   site   extending to   the   kerb      channel   on   the   street(s),   showing   the outline of the house and the extent of the roof   (dotted).   Take   care when   transferring   the   outline   of the   house to the site   plan – ensure that the scale   is consistent.


b.          Your site   plan should give all information   pertaining to the   site   including   site   bearings   and   dimensions, north   point, site area,   Lot and   Plan   number (RPD) and setback   dimensions to   the   house   and   outermost   projections.   Include existing vegetation to remain and to   be   removed.
c.          Show all   proposed site   elements   external to   the   house –   landscaping   areas,   driveways   etc. You   can   be   a   little creative with   this, but the   location of any retaining walls   should   be   appropriate   with   respect   to   (d.) below.
d.          Indicate the ground shaping strategy and   direction   of overland   drainage.
e.          Show the   location of existing services external to the   site,   and   proposed   connection   lines   to   the   house   (source   information from   Dial   Before You   Dig)
f.             On a copy of the site   plan, analyze   the   site   in   terms   of   locality,   existing falls   across   the   site   and   orientation.   Indicate solar access and   prevailing breezes, and direction   of views   (favourable or unfavourable).
House   Plan   (5%)
a.          A3   print out directly from   builder’s website – there   is   no   need to adjust the floor   plan,   but   a   bar   scale   should   be added to   indicate scale.
b.          代 写SSUD71-101 Understanding Buildings 241: Assignment 2R
代做程序编程语言You   must include cross section   location (Section A – A), north   point   and   elevation   cross/indicator.   Note:   it is recommended that you obtain advice from   your   teacher(s)   for the   location   of your section   line.   The      north   point should relate to the   positioning of the house   onto your   site.
Note: sometimes   it will   be necessary to use a ‘mirror’   image   of your   house to   properly   suit the   site   orientation.   If this   is the case,   please   make a   note to that effect.   It is   not   necessary   to   re-draw   the   floor   plan,   but all other drawings should   be the mirrored version.   Plans from   some   builders will   be   able   to   be   mirrored before you   print them out.
Section A – A   (10%)
Scale:    1:20 or   as   required   to   fit   onto   A3paper
a.                         Draw a cross section through the   building   labelled ‘Section A – A’, taken   at the   location   of the section   line shown on the floor   plan.
b.                      Show   Natural Ground   Level   (NGL) and   Finished   Ground   Level   (FGL)   at   the   section   location.
c.                         Give   height levels   above   FGL   for:
•                        finished   floor   level.
•                      joinery   height   (top   of   windows      doors).
•                        ceiling   height.
d.                      The section should   be fully annotated for   all   materials   shown.   Materials   should   be   identified   by   standard hatching patterns where appropriate.
e.                      Appropriate labelling   is   required as   it   carries   significant weighting for this   drawing   (labelling   should   include at minimum element name   and   material specification).
Scale   Model   (35%)
Using   materials sourced from art/craft stores, local hardware   stores   and   the   like,   create   a   1:20   scale   model   of a cross-section of the house approximately 4.0m wide, between   the   outer walls   of the   building   and the Section A-A location which has   been identified   on the   drawings.
•                      For   the   purpose   of the   model   the   roof will   be assumed   to   be   a   gable   roof.
•                      Accurate representation   of the   building structure   and   materials will   be   assessed   as   part   of this task. Therefore cut-outs, showing the wall structure, internal and external   materials   and   roof formation   are   required.
•                      Model   shall   be   made with   heavyweight   card   and/or   balsawood.   Use   material/textural   differences   to   indicate different building components.
•                      Use   machine-like   precision with   no   glue   evident.   Cut   all   materials   cleanly   and   neatly.
The   purpose of the model is to demonstrate your   understanding of the   structure,   construction,   and materials. Therefore, attention should be   paid to the correct   and   careful   detailing   of these elements.
The cross-section drawing will directly relate to the cut   through   location   of the   model   and the   correlation   of   these two items will   be carefully   assessed.
Important:
Model   making   may   be done off-campus and   must   not be completed   in   any   room of the   University   other   than the designated spaces allocated for this   purpose. After week 4, an announcement will   be   issued to   let   students   know which room can   be used to work   in your   models.
Submission:
•                      Assignment 2 groups   comprise four students   each.   To form   a   group,   use   the   self-enrollment   link   provided on   iLearn. All team members must join the same group   number   before the   due   date.
•                      Student   ID   numbers for   all students   in   the   group   must   appear   on   all written   and   drawing   sheets,   and   on the   base of the   model.
•                      All drawings are   to   be   presented   on   A3   paper with   a   title   block   giving   the   names   and   SID   of all   group   members, the drawing   name and   bar scale.   For this   purpose, a standard title   block should   be prepared which can   be used on   all   drawing sheets.
•                      Drawings   are   to   be   folded   simply   and   neatly   to A4   size   so   that   they   can   be   unfolded   and   read   easily.
•                      Due   to   the   nature   of   the   assignment,   only the   written   components   of   each   part   are   to   be   lodged
through the assignment portal on iLearn on   or   before   the   due   date. Also   include   a   digital   version   of   all drawings annexed to the final submission for marking   purposes.
•                      Hardcopies,   properly   bound,   are   to   be   submitted   to   the   drop-box   Level   2,   Building   3,   with   a   completed assignment cover sheet on or before   the   due   date.
•                      An announcement will   be   issued after Week   4, to   advise   the   drop-off   location   of the   building   models   (the same assignment due date applies for model   submissions).    All   models   are to   be   collected   and   removed from the designated   location after marking   I completed.
•                         If there are any concerns regarding group   interactions,   please contact   us well   in   advance. All   team   members are anticipated to contribute equally to the task.   If a   lack   of engagement   or   contribution from a teammate   is observed   by the majority, kindly   inform   us   by Week   9.   We   will   make   efforts   to mediate or explore further options.   It's   important to   note that we won't be able   to   assist   if these   issues are raised shortly   before or after the assessment's   due   date,   as the   timeframe   at   that   stage   won't allow for alternative arrangements.
